# Cerberus Log Processor Lambda

This is a JVM based lambda for processing access log events. It is part of the [edge security](http://engineering.nike.com/cerberus/docs/architecture/infrastructure-overview)
solution for [Cerberus](http://engineering.nike.com/cerberus/).

ALBAccessLogEventHandler::handleScheduledEvent(), gets triggered every 5 minutes.
ALBAccessLogEventHandler has a list of processors that can ingest the events and do various things like rate limiting.

To learn more about Cerberus, please see the [Cerberus website](http://engineering.nike.com/cerberus/).

## Processors

### Rate Limiting Processor
This processor will query Athena and ensures that ips that show up more than the requests per interval limit are added to the auto block list for the Cerberus Env WAF

### Future Processors
We would like to have a processor for auto blocking ips that spam bad requests.

## Building

To build and deploy the fat jar required for Lambda run `./gradlew cerberus-log-processor-lambda:sJ cerberus-log-processor-lambda:deploySam -Penv=[ENVIRONMENT]`

## Updating

To update with a new version, you'll need to remove the principal added to the alb log bucket and then delete stack before running the above command.
